    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>It’s the brick walls you may remember first. Perhaps you are sixteen and a proper ‘90’s New York teenager when you make your way to the Nuyorican’s Open Mic night. At the door, security is both security and welcome committee, waving you and your friend further in, yes, you’re in the right place, go on in, ask the bartender for how to sign up. The room, in the style of most old East Village tenement buildings, is a long rectangle. The street facing and the back walls are the narrow sides, so when you walk in, and you are a nervous teenager, the stage seems far away, past a whole landscape of bar and tables and chairs. It is dark and smokey. (Yes, it is legal to smoke cigarettes indoors at this moment in time.) The friendly ushering continues, you are shooed to the front by the bartender, and then the regulars. The notebook to sign up for the Open Mic is right up there, lit up on an old music stand at the base of the stage. In front of all, you and your friend sign your names, exhale, get your cokes, and settle into your small table to wait for the emcee to start the night. This night that is so momentous to you in fact happens every week. It’s the Nuyorican Open Room, the event that has been at the heart of its offerings and mission since the beginning. 
 </p>
    <p>The Nuyorican Café began ushering poets to the stage in 1973, when it was founded in the living room of poet Miguel Algarín. Algarín created the salon as a space for poets, playwrights, and musicians of color to perform, in front of an audience, in a time when their work was often dismissed and/or rejected by mainstream creative industries. It was the catalyst for a movement of performance poetry vital to the Puerto Rican diaspora and African American cultural scene, and the overflow crowds eventually led to the purchase of the building at 236 east 6th street, where it has been housed ever since.
</p>
    <p>The Nuyorican has grown into a dynamic, successful and highly awarded arts organization, that continues to center its programming with New York’s communities of color. It’s perhaps best known for its slam poetry open mics and grand slams, but also hosts Jazz and Hip-hop concerts, plays, educational programs and visual arts exhibits.
</p>
    <p>When it’s finally your turn to walk to the stage, you are a little bit terrified. You’ve never performed your poetry in front of an audience of strangers, and it is possible that you’ve never had a chance to read a poem in a room that is almost all Brown and Black folks. You’re going to be reading about your family, and it is easier to do that in this room then at your majority-White school. You may not realize it in that moment, but that is part of why the Nuyorican exists, to give generations of poets and artists a safer space to both experiment and flex. Later, you won’t remember the words of the poem, nor are you a “triumph” in any way. But when you’re done you are applauded, and on your way back to your seat, other poets shake your hand, congratulatory, saying “Come back next week.” You don’t know it then, but in twenty years you’re going to be a teacher and you’re going to tell one of your students, “I’m not sure if it’s happening, but if it is, I think you’d really like the Nuyorican.” And she looks at you like it’s so obvious. “I perform there all the time,” she’ll say, “It’s the best.”
</p>
    <p>The Nuyorican is likely to continue to thrive in New York City. 236 East 6th is closed for a massive renovation that began in 2023, dubbed the “the Nuyoreconstruction.” In the meantime, Nuyorican events have dispersed across the city, returning to its pop-up roots, until the new building opens as a multi-purpose art, educational and performance cultural hub.
