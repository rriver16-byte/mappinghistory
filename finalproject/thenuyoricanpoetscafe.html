    <p>"We must listen to one another. We must respect one another's habits and we must share the truth and the integrity that the voice of the poet so generously provides."

    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>It’s the brick walls I remember first. I was sixteen and a proper ‘90’s New York teenager when I made my way to the Nuyorican’s Open Mic night. At the door, security was both security and also welcome committee, waving my friend and I further in, yes, we were in the right place, go on in, ask the bartender for how to sign up. The room, in the style of most old East Village tenement buildings, was a long rectangle. The street facing and the back walls were the narrow sides, so when you walked in, and you were a nervous teenager, the stage seemed far away, past a whole landscape of bar and tables and chairs. It was dark and smokey. (Yes, it was legal to smoke cigarettes indoors then.) The ushering continued, shooed to the front by the bartender, and then the regulars. The notebook to sign up for the Open Mic was right up there in the front, lit up, at the base of the stage. In front of all, my friend and I signed our names, exhaled, got our cokes, and settled into our small table to wait.</p>
    <p>The Nuyorican Café has been ushering poets to the stage since 1973, when it was founded in the living room of poet Miguel Algarin. Algarin created the salon as a space for poets, playwrights, and musicians of color to perform, in front of an audience, in a time when their work was often dismissed and/or rejected by mainstream creative industries. It was the catalyst for a movement of performance poetry vital to the Puerto Rican diaspora and African American cultural scene, and the overflow crowds eventually led to the purchase of the building at 236 east 6th street, where it has been housed ever since.</p>
    <p>The Nuyorican has grown into a dynamic, successful and highly awarded arts organization, that continues to center its programming with New York’s communities of color. It’s perhaps best known for its slam poetry open mics and grand slams, but also hosts Jazz and Hip-hop concerts, plays, educational programs and visual arts exhibits.</p>
    <p>When it finally my turn to walk to the stage, I had never performed my poetry in front of an audience of strangers, nor had I ever had a chance to read a poem about myself, to a room of mostly Brown and Black folks. I don’t remember a word of that poem, nor was I a “triumph” in any way. But I was cheered to the stage and applauded for the simple act of getting up there. Fast forward twenty years to me recommending the Nuyorican to a high school student in my writing workshop. “Oh yeah,” she said, matter of fact, “I perform there all the time. It’s the best.”</p>
    <p>The Nuyorican is likely to continue to thrive in New York City. 236 East 6th is closed for a massive renovation that began in 2023.  In the meantime, Nuyorican events have dispersed across the city, returning to its pop-up roots, until the new building opens as a multi-purpose arts, educational and performance cultural hub.</p>
